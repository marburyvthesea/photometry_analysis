##alignment steps

# create dataframe of TTL sync pulses with a time column from start of the video

# create dataframe of grooming/behavior information from ethovision file, also with a time column from start of the video

# get the indicies of sync pulses from the abf recording

# form continous array with the intermediate frame numbers between pulses and time stamps to add into the photometry df

# pad the array with zeros at the end of the sweep

# take the photometry data array, and, for each sample point:
#   1) find the time of the closest frame analyzed by ethovision in the ethovision array
#	2) get the time of the frame
#   3) add the grooming/behavior value for this frame to the photometry data
# by iterating over all the samples in the photometry data file, this will "upsample" the behavior analysis and align it # to the information already in the photometry data for the abf file


# fold this back into the original photometry df
